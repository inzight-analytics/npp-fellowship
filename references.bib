  abstract = {Hierarchical clustering is one of the standard methods taught for identifying and exploring the underlying structures that may be present within a data set. Students are shown examples in which the dendrogram, a visual representation of the hierarchical clustering, reveals a clear clustering structure. However, in practice, data analysts today frequently encounter data sets whose large scale undermines the usefulness of the dendrogram as a visualization tool. Densely packed branches obscure structure, and overlapping labels are impossible to read. In this paper we present a new workflow for performing hierarchical clustering via the R package called protoshiny that aims to restore hierarchical clustering to its former role of being an effective and versatile visualization tool. Our proposal leverages interactivity combined with the ability to label internal nodes in a dendrogram with a representative data point (called a prototype). After presenting the workflow, we provide three case studies to demonstrate its utility.},

  abstract = {Rserve is a TCP/IP server which allows other programs to use facilities of R from various languages without the need to initialize R or link to the R library. Every connection has a separate workspace and working directory. Client-side implementations are available for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java. Rserve supports remote connection, authentication and file transfer. This paper describes the Rserve concept, compares it with other techniques and illustrates its use on several practical examples.},
